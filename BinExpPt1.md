# Binary Exploitation: Part1
  > Binary Exploitation involves manipulating executable files to behave unlike how they were intended. This exploitation could be using the files permissions to access other inaccessible files or to gain secure information in the file. In CTF competitions, sometimes source code is provided with the executable, but other times only the binary is provided. This section serves as an introduction to the essential Linux commands and concepts needed to exploit a binary.  

## File 
  When first presented with a binary, it is usually helpful to run the **file** command before doing anything else with the executable.
