## UD Cyber CTF Club

We meet every Friday (during Fall and Spring semesters) in the iSuites (Evans Hall 132) from 3-5pm.  We will try to run practice CTFs every week during our meetings.

### Learning Resources

At this site we will aggregate resources, links, guides, and other useful information to help you get stronger at CTFs.
